## Functionality 
The idea of our app is simple. When you see a brand you don't know, you can scan it and find out which company owns that brand, and, if it is publicly traded, it's ticker. This should be usefull for when you see a new product in the store that is getting bought up and you want to buy that companies stock! 

### Scan 


`Simply take a picture of the product to learn more.
